This project combines the Internet of Things technology, Beidou positioning technology and SLAM technology to develop a landslide warning and monitoring car with multiple functions. The trolley mainly solves the problems of small blind spots in static monitoring nodes and monitoring failure caused by external factors caused by fixed monitoring nodes. The car integrates various functions such as prediction algorithm, roadblock removal, Beidou positioning, SLAM synchronous positioning and navigation, high-precision sensor monitoring, 360-degree video monitoring without dead angle, and solar charging.
Project innovation:
1. Automatic inspection and monitoring area based on SLAM
Equipped with Beidou/GPS positioning module and SLAM lidar module, it can realize autonomous navigation of the car to reach the designated monitoring position.
2. Based on Beidou navigation and positioning
Effectively extract the latitude and longitude information of the area to be detected, and accurately locate the position of the car.
3. Crawler body structure and 3D printing technology
In order to cope with the complex terrain environment in the wild, the car adopts crawler wheels, and some special parts of the car body are realized by 3D printing technology.
4. Integrate machine learning algorithms to realize disaster early warning and prediction
In the cloud, machine learning algorithms are used to fuse sensor data to achieve early warning and prediction of landslides and other disasters.
