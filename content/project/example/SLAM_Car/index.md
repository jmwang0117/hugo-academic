Landslides and other geological disasters can result in large property losses and personal casualties, necessitating long-term intense monitoring of disaster-prone locations. Traditional monitoring systems, on the other hand, are unable to adequately monitor disaster-prone locations at close range. As a result, an independent development of a multi-functional landslide catastrophe warning and monitoring trolley based on the Arduino platform is offered. The multi-functional landslide disaster early warning and monitoring trolley that will be developed and designed in this project is equipped with a Beidou/GPS positioning module that can perform automatic inspection on the designated route; it also incorporates multiple sensor modules to monitor the key elements that may cause geological disasters in designated areas.Equipped with surveillance cameras to collect image data in real time; the monitoring data and real-time images will be sent back to the server through the wireless network module for storage and storage. The data analysis and mining platform is deployed in the server, which will analyze and mine the monitoring data returned regularly, establish a landslide disaster prediction model to predict the development of the disaster situation in the later period, and obtain the current state information of the monitoring area. Managers can view the monitoring data and the prediction results of the disaster prediction model in real time through the mobile APP application. When the prediction model analyzes that geological disasters are about to occur, early warning information will be issued in time through the APP platform, so as to assist decision makers in early preparation and prevention.




#### **System Features:**

* Accuracy up to millimeter level

The Beidou satellite navigation and positioning system has the highest certification accuracy in the industry, and the whole system has strong multi-frequency anti-interference ability, which can realize high-precision monitoring of the three-dimensional deformation of the surface of the geological disaster point.

* Support multi-mode communication

It supports multiple communication methods such as GPRS/Beidou short message/4G/LoRa/NB-lot, and the real-time information transmission is strong.

* Ultra-low-power design

Integrated design, low power consumption, support for years of maintenance-free operation, stable performance, easy installation, complete monitoring.

* Remote device management

Really realize the remote interconnection of equipment, remote management of equipment and system upgrades can be realized with the help of the platform, and mobile client login system is also supported , so that data and alarm information can be conveniently and quickly viewed anytime, anywhere

* High system reliability

In response to different disaster forms, the effective selection and matching of sensors, while actively responding to national policies, realize the promotion of universal monitoring equipment, which not only achieves cost control , but also ensures the stability and reliability of the system for a long time.

* Autonomous platform service

The team independently builds a big data platform service architecture, uses cloud services to distribute, process, balance, manage and analyze data in real-time, and uses the web to interact with data, conduct professional model analysis for each monitoring point, and start based on the results of data fusion To the early warning and scheduling role
