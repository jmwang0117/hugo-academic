This project combines the Internet of Things technology, Beidou positioning technology and SLAM technology to develop a landslide warning and monitoring car with multiple functions. The trolley mainly solves the problems of small blind spots in static monitoring nodes and monitoring failure caused by external factors caused by fixed monitoring nodes. The car integrates various functions such as prediction algorithm, roadblock removal, Beidou positioning, SLAM synchronous positioning and navigation, high-precision sensor monitoring, 360-degree video monitoring without dead angle, and solar charging.
Project innovation:
1. Automatic inspection and monitoring area based on SLAM
Equipped with Beidou/GPS positioning module and SLAM lidar module, it can realize autonomous navigation of the car to reach the designated monitoring position.
2. Based on Beidou navigation and positioning
Effectively extract the latitude and longitude information of the area to be detected, and accurately locate the position of the car.
3. Crawler body structure and 3D printing technology
In order to cope with the complex terrain environment in the wild, the car adopts crawler wheels, and some special parts of the car body are realized by 3D printing technology.
4. Integrate machine learning algorithms to realize disaster early warning and prediction
In the cloud, machine learning algorithms are used to fuse sensor data to achieve early warning and prediction of landslides and other disasters.



#### **System Features:**

* Accuracy up to millimeter level

The Beidou satellite navigation and positioning system has the highest certification accuracy in the industry, and the whole system has strong multi-frequency anti-interference ability, which can realize high-precision monitoring of the three-dimensional deformation of the surface of the geological disaster point.

* Support multi-mode communication

It supports multiple communication methods such as GPRS/Beidou short message/4G/LoRa/NB-lot, and the real-time information transmission is strong.

* Ultra-low-power design

Integrated design, low power consumption, support for years of maintenance-free operation, stable performance, easy installation, complete monitoring.

* Remote device management

Really realize the remote interconnection of equipment, remote management of equipment and system upgrades can be realized with the help of the platform, and mobile client login system is also supported , so that data and alarm information can be conveniently and quickly viewed anytime, anywhere

* High system reliability

In response to different disaster forms, the effective selection and matching of sensors, while actively responding to national policies, realize the promotion of universal monitoring equipment, which not only achieves cost control , but also ensures the stability and reliability of the system for a long time.

* Autonomous platform service

The team independently builds a big data platform service architecture, uses cloud services to distribute, process, balance, manage and analyze data in real-time, and uses the web to interact with data, conduct professional model analysis for each monitoring point, and start based on the results of data fusion To the early warning and scheduling role
